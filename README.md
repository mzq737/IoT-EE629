### Report 6 2020/10/17
###### 1. Applebot 
What is Applebot? A web crawler for Apple. Products like Siri and Spotlight Suggestions use Applebot. So users don't have to rely on third-party tools like Google, Bing to search what they need. Compared to the big boy Googlebot, which is the famous web crawler, Applebot may never be able to compete with it, but judging from the release of ARM-based Apple silicon this year, Apple has this ambition to further expand its ecosystem.

###### 2. Googlebot will soon speak HTTP/2
Starting November 2020, Googlebot will start crawling some sites over HTTP/2.

What is [HTTP/2][HTTP/2]?

###### 3. Project Process
Completed the first part of data crawling.

[HTTP/2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2

### Report 2 2020/09/21
###### The History of the Internet of Things
Most of the early smart home inventions used automatic controls, making it
possible to turn something or off without lifting a finger. But they didn’t connect
to anything else, and their functionality was limited. That would begin to change
in 1983 when ARPANET, the earliest version of the internet, adopted the
internet protocol suite (also known as TCP/IP). The protocol set standards for
how digital data should be transmitted, routed, and received. Essentially, it laid
the groundwork for the modern internet.
The term “internet of things” itself was coined in 1999, when Kevin Ashton put
it in a PowerPoint presentation for Procter & Gamble. Ashton, who was then
working in supply chain optimization, described a system where sensors acted
like the eyes and ears of a computer—an entirely new way for computers to
see, hear, touch, and interpret their surroundings.
Installed Django, Flask, Ngrok:
